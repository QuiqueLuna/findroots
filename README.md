# findroots

This program find the real roots of a cubic polynomial. In order to test the code run the findroots.exe a b c d. The parameters being the coefficients of the degree three polynomial. 

The way the algorithm works is by knowing the fact that any polynomial of odd degree will have atleast one real root, meaning we can use Newton method in order to find it, then factorize the root of the polynomial and finally solving a cuadratic polynomial with the cuadratic formula.
